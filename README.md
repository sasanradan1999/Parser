# Parser
We’ll look into understanding the basic concepts of a “parser”. We’ll create a basic parser library from scratch, 
and then introduce some useful “parser combinators which will enable us to parse single character (v1.0) and a string (v2.0).

In-depth explanation of parsing:
  - a single character can be found on http://www.sasanradan.com/post2.php
  - a string can be found on http://www.sasanradan.com/post3.php (coming soon)
